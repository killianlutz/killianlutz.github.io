My PhD project deals with control of open quantum systems applied to quantum information. It is supervised by [Emmanuel Franck](https://irma.math.unistra.fr/~franck/index.html) (INRIA) and [Yannick Privat](https://yannick-privat.perso.math.cnrs.fr) (IECL).

The aim of the PhD project is to develop numerical methods suited to the **control** of **non-isolated** discrete quantum systems known as **qudits**. The latter are analoguous to 'bits' in classical computing and the underlying mathematical model is the **GKS-Lindblad equation**. 

This topic is of interest in the field of quantum computing. For instance, given a logical operation (e.g. NOT gate in classical computing) the aim is to find appropriate electro-magnetic pulses whose effect on qudits is the same as the theoretical description of the logical operation.
You may find a brief interactive introduction to this matter in the following Git [repository](https://github.com/killianlutz/BlochBallAnim.jl).

What makes this project challenging? Mathematically it is about *non-linear* control theory. Numerically and from a practical point of view, the state space associated to the mathematical model is *high-dimensional* and grows exponentially fast (e.g. more than '10 to the power 30' degrees of freedom for a realistic coupled system of 100 qubits).

This project is a collaboration with physicists from the team of [Paul-Antoine Hervieux](https://www.ipcms.fr/en/paul-antoine-hervieux/) (IPCMS).

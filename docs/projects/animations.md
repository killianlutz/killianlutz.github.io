# Open qubits & Bloch ball
The Bloch ball provides is a fundamental tool which provides a geometrical interpretation for the dynamics and control of quantum systems known as qubits.

Check out this [interactive animation](https://github.com/killianlutz/BlochBallAnim.jl) to build up your intuition on quantum mechanics!

# Optimization: less math, more intuition
Conservative physical systems reach equilibrium when minimizing their potential energy. What if we tried to understand the mechanics behind the classical algorithms for continuous optimization using such a principle?

Check out the resulting [animations](https://github.com/killianlutz/IntuitiveOptimization)!

# Lotka-Volterra model & flow of dynamical systems
Seeking to improve your tools to perform qualitative analysis of dynamical systems and their linearizations? 

Check out this [interactive animation](https://github.com/killianlutz/LVDemo.jl)!
